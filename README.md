<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 We have provided a tool for confiers and confidants alike to stay connected with the click of a button. This tool can be used between healthcare professionals and clients or even professors and students. 

### Inspiration/Problem
RateMyMental is a mental health resource and solution to the long wait times for counselling services. In addition, this tool provides a quick and <b>contactless</b> ways to notify others of your current mental state.

### Features
* "How are you feeling..." - send a live check-in (1-bad, 9-great) to your host
* Insights - keep track of your moods over the past week and see notes from your host
* Profile - See a visual display of your daily moods 

### Challenges you ran into
* Members of the group were not familiar with our tech stack, so starting the project was slow, but spending time reading documentatio and watching tutorials was well worth our time since development sped up afterwards
* Though the site ran well on each of our local environments, deployment caused several unforseen issues

### What you learned/are proud of
* We learned so much about React and how amzing it is during development!!
* We are proud of reaching the deployment stage in such a short period of time 

### What's next!
* We are excited about our site and hope to extend it beyond "professors" and "students"
